description     The Scala Programming Language
long_description \
                Scala is a modern multi-paradigm programming language \
                designed to express common programming patterns in a \
                concise, elegant, and type-safe way.  It smoothly \
                integrates features of object-oriented and functional \
                languages.  It runs inside a Java Virtual Machine and \
                is fully interoperable with Java.
