description         A FUSE-Compliant File System Implementation Mechanism \
                    for Mac OS X

long_description    Fuse4X implements a mechanism that makes it          \
                    possible to implement a fully functional file        \
                    system in a user-space program on Mac OS X. It       \
                    aims to be API-compliant with the FUSE               \
                    (File-system in USErspace) mechanism that            \
                    originated on Linux.  Therefore, many existing       \
                    FUSE file systems become readily usable on Mac OS    \
                    X. This port provides the user-space library and     \
                    header files for building filesystems.
