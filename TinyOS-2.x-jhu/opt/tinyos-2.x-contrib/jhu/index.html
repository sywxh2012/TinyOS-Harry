not a complete LPL replacement. The interface is similar with LPL but
simpler and slightly different. More details can be found in
<tt>lpp/README</tt>. In the same directory there two applications,
<tt>TestLppNode</tt> and <tt>TestLppBasestation</tt> which demonstrate
the intend use.</p>

communication. An earlier version was included in the tools package of
TinyOS 2.0.2 as part of the Deluge T2.</p>
