<h1>SING Contributions</h1>

<p>Currently, SING has one contribution in the repository, an application
for sampling RSSI from the CC2420 at high frequency (up to 1.3 kHz). All code
and documentation, unless otherwise specified, is under 
the <A HREF="license.txt">Stanford SING license</A>, which is 
a <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">"new BSD" license</A>.
</p>

<h2>RssiSample</h2>
<p>The RssiSample application samples the RSSI register of the CC2420
radio on the telosb platform at a fixed rate. At compile-time, you can 
configure the rate as well as the number of samples to collect. When the node
boots, it begins sampling, storing the readings to flash. When it collects
all of the samples, it sends them the the UART. There is a Java application
to read the UART messages and print the results. The 
<A HREF="apps/RssiSample/README.txt">README</A> has further details.</p>
