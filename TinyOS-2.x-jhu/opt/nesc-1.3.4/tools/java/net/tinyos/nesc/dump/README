Support classes for reading nesC XML dump information. The schema for
the XML elements is in doc/dump.

The main class for reading the XML dumps is NDReader. Each XML element is 
parsed as a Java class; these classes are found in the net.tinyos.nesc.dump.xml
package. See the documentation in these classes for detailed information.
